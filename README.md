*A transactional API for ordered, key-value stores in Rust.*

Slonky's goal is to make it easier to work with low-level, byte-centric, transactional, ordered, key-value stores.
It does this by providing a common API that works across multiple stores.
This project simply provides a set of Rust traits that define the interface for Slonky.
See the list of related projects below for instances of these interfaces.
