# Ligature-REPL

## Running

This project is setup as an application in gradle.
On Windows `gradle run` doesn't work correctly (I haven't tested Linux/MacOS yet).
So instead run `.\run.bat`.

## Commands

### :exit

Exit the REPL.

### :help

Print all Commands and their arguments if there are any.

### :kts

Run Kotlin code via JSR-223.

### :instance

View the current instance of Ligature being used.

### :use-in-memory

Switch the current Ligature instance to a newly created in-memory instance.
