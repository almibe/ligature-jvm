# Ligature-REPL

## Running

This project is setup as an application in gradle.
On Windows `gradle run` doesn't work correctly (I haven't tested Linux/MacOS yet).
So instead run `.\run.bat`.

## Commands

The following are functions that are added to Wander's standard library when using the REPL.

### exit()

Exit the REPL.

### help()

Prints documentation.

### bindings()

Lists all the currently bound names.
