# ligature-zeromq

This project exposes a ZeroMQ socket that handles requests for working with a Ligature instance.
This project is under development and its api is likely to change drastically.
Currently a request is a string of Wander code that is ran against a given instance of Ligature.
The result of the script is returned.
